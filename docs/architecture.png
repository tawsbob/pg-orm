This file should be replaced with an actual architecture diagram PNG image.

The diagram should visualize the layered architecture of PG-ORM:
1. Schema Layer
2. Client Layer
3. Database Layer
4. Extension Layer

With connections between components as described in the architecture.md documents.

You can use tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or mermaid to create this diagram.
